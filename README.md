# WhoTextedThat - Work in Progress

This is a project to scrape Whatsapp data and gain fun insights and analytics for our yearly family quiz.

Every year around christmas I run a quiz for my family where I look back at all the texts from the year and try to pick out quotes that are funny, in order for my family to guess who texted it. This year I thought I would take the game to the next level and intertwine my passion for exploratory data analysis by including questions revolving based around statistics of the family's texting behaviour. This is the code I used to do so.
